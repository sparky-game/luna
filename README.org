* Build from source

First, ensure the source tree is absolutely clean. From /Sparky/ we recommend this command to be issued prior to each compilation; do not rely on the source tree being clean after cloning the repository or after un-tarring:

#+begin_src sh
make mrproper
#+end_src

To build Luna, issue the following command:

#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src
